    The toy robot can only be placed and moved on a {TABLE_SIZE_X}x{TABLE_SIZE_Y} table.
    The table coordinates are zero based.

    place
        - this command places the toy robot on the table.
        - this should be the first command issued before any other toy robot movements can be made.

        syntax:
            place <x>,<y>,<f>

            x -> is the vertical column on the table
            y -> is the horizontal row on the table
            f -> is the direction the toy robot will face; can either be 'north', 'east', 'south' or 'west'

        example:
            place 3,2,east

            This will place the robot on column 3, row 2 and facing east.

    left
        - this command will turn the toy robot 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
        - if you turn the toy robot before it is placed, the command is ignored.

        syntax:
            left

        example:
            left

            If the toy robot was facing north, this command will turn the toy robot towards the west.

    right
        - this will turn the toy robot 90 degrees clockwise.
        - if you turn the toy robot before it is placed, the command is ignored.

        syntax:
            right

        example:
            right

            If the toy robot was facing north, this command will turn the toy robot towards the east.

    move
        - this command moves the toy robot one grid unit towards the direction it is facing.
        - if you move the toy robot before it is placed, the command is ignored.
        - if the move will throw the toy robot off the table, the command is ignored.

        syntax:
            move

        example:
            move

            This will move the robot one grid unit towards the direction it is facing only if it is valid.

    report
        - this command will output the toy robot's current coordinates and the current direction it is facing.

        syntax:
            report

        example:
            report

            If the toy robot is at 3, 2 and facing south, the output would be:
            "3,2,south"
